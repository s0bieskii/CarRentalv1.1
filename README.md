# About project: :car:
It is my main project which I'm still developing, it is a Spring web car rental application, that provides REST API for communication and MVC pattern.
The data is stored in a relational database which is accessed through JPA/Hibernate. The application is divided into client, employee, and administrator layers, thanks to which I increase its security. The main security features of the application are the use of DTOs, Spring Validation, and the most important Spring Security, which is responsible for user authentication.
- As a customer of a rental company we can register, login, dynamically filter available cars, rent a car, manage rentals, edit rentals and account details, delete account
- As an employee we can manage a calendar of rentals, control the current status of the rental, edit car data, receive and give cars to customers with the creation of reports of issuance and return report.
- As an administrator we can add new cars and assign them to rental branches, manage employees, add new employees, generate monthly reports. I created the front-end layer using Thymeleaf and Bootstrap.
